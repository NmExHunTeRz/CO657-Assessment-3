# CO657-Assessment-3

## Roadmap

- _29/12_ Be familiar with data and be able to manipulate it
- _01/12_ Confident Prototype, pulling and visualising data from all graphs

## General Ideas

  Build in standard templates which can be accessed from dashboard
  Dashboard having different checkboxes which can limit the data being shown
  Separation of sensors in each location/each type of sensor
  
## For next time

  Huy - Have a look at actually getting the data
  Dan/Deniz - Look into the different graphing methods - Decide on the graph packages
